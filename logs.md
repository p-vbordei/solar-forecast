# Development Logs - Solar Forecast Python Worker

## 2025-09-02

### Initial Analysis & PRD Creation

**Prompt Received:**
> "I need you in this folder now to create the python worker based on the code here: /Users/vladbordei/Documents/Development/solar_forecast_linear, however still using the architecture patterns from claude.md. I want to be very clear and to the point. Prepare every single detail end to end before starting. Create a PRD with the full scope of the project and all details required to implement before starting."

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Analyzed Existing Codebase** ✅
   - Examined `solar_forecast_linear` directory structure
   - Reviewed main application entry point (`app.py`)
   - Analyzed forecasting scripts in `/scripts` directory
   - Reviewed client configurations (YAML files)
   - Examined dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

2. **Key Findings from Analysis:**
   - Existing system uses a monolithic script-based approach
   - No classes per requirements - only functions
   - Forecasting pipeline includes:
     - Weather data fetching (Open-Meteo API)
     - Physics-based solar modeling (pvlib)
     - Machine learning predictions (CatBoost)
     - Hybrid forecast generation
     - Email reporting system
   - Supports 3 solar plants currently (Maghebo, Envolteco, Crispvol)
   - Uses CET timezone for energy market operations
   - Railway deployment configured

3. **Created Comprehensive PRD** ✅
   - Document: `PRD_SOLAR_FORECAST_WORKER.md`
   - Defined complete system architecture
   - Specified CSR (Controller-Service-Repository) pattern
   - Detailed API endpoints
   - Database schema design
   - Integration requirements
   - Implementation phases (7-day plan)
   - Migration strategy from existing code

**Architecture Decisions:**
- FastAPI for the web framework (async support, auto-documentation)
- UV package manager as specified
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- CSR pattern without classes (functions only)
- Maintain existing ML models and physics calculations

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin implementation of Python worker
2. Create project structure
3. Setup UV environment
4. Implement core CSR architecture
